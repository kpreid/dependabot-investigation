  # Workspaces generally expect to be able to compile everything for the same target,
  # but all-is-cubes-wasm only compiles on wasm and all-is-cubes-desktop doesn't.
  # Specific advantages:
  # * The wasm workspace has Cargo config telling it to be built for wasm32-unknown-unknown,
  #   which rust-analyzer picks up, so all IDE assistance works.
  # 
  # Disadvantages, or advantages of the alternative of merely `cfg`-disabling all the wasm-only
  # code:
  # * `cargo fmt`, `cargo tree`, etc. don't work on this code (but `xtask` provides
  #   all-workspaces commands).

  # "all-is-cubes-wasm",
  
  # Including this makes the fuzz targets automatically built so we know they aren't broken.
  # But, `cargo test` sometimes ignores `[[bin]] test = false` directives,
  #     https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8338
  # so doing this causes test failures in thise circumstances.
  # As a substitute, I've included explicitly building the fuzz targets in the `xtask` build process.
